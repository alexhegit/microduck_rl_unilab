"""Drift guard for the MicroDuck × microduck_rl alignment contract (issue #1453).

For each MicroDuck locomotion task (ppo tree, mjwarp owner) the declared
status of every contract entry must agree with its evaluated value:

- ``match`` entries must keep matching the upstream target (drift guard).
- ``gap`` entries must keep NOT matching (the gap set only shrinks when a
  child issue lands an alignment change and flips the entry in
  ``alignment_contract.ENTRIES`` in the same commit — this test is the
  explicit checklist enforcing that).
- ``note`` entries are informational and not judged.
